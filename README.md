Image-based Market Movement Prediction through Deep Learning

– Achieved 80% of classification accuracy for future market movement (uptrend, downtrend, correction) through long short-term memory (LSTM), and gated recurrent units (GRU) with 256 hidden neurons and 30,000 training steps.

– Proposed a novel approach to predict future market movement through captured images instead of actual price.

– Incorporated indicator like moving average (MA) and structure/pattern like head and shoulders into training system.
